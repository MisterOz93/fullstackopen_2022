When you want to work with the DOM or CSS, right-click an element 
on the page and select Inspect to jump into the Elements panel. (or ctl/shift/c)

console.log("Hi Console") <- syntax for getting something(js) in console

right click element on dom tree "scroll to view" to go there on browser

ctrl f while hovering over element panel should pop up search bar within code

can change nodes, content and position thru dom tree panel. 

h makes the selected node disappear/reappear

right click -> copy -> copy js path lets you paste a js query to paste in console



note: html represents the initial page content, DOM represents current content 
(after scripts are run etc)
