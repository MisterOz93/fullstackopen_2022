ls = List files (-a for all, -l for detailed list, 
pwd = present work directory
ln = link (Hard link creates copy, ex: ln a.txt b.txt <- creates b.txt)
rm = remove (Hard link copy stays even if source is removed)
ln -f = forces a link even if b already exists
ln -s = symbolic link, can link to files and directories on other file systems,
more powerful and common than hard link

cd = change directory [ex: cd ~/Documents (not all take a ~ ?)

cd .. = move to parent directory

cd on its own returns to home directory

mkdir = make directory (name of direc after a space) (great place to store and organize files)
mkdir -p = make a nested directory
mkdir -v = tells you what you did (I think?) 
rmdir = remove (empty) directory
rm -r = remove directory  

cp = copy file [ex: cp x y] creates copy of x named y
Can copy multiple files to a directory (directory has to be last part)
cp -r = copy directory to another directory (use -Rv to see what you did)
cp -f = force copy (in case files have different owners)
cp -i = gives you a confirmation prompt

mv = move file (basically copies it and deletes original. only same filesystem)

Pipe (shift+ \ -> |) = Makes the Output of first command the input of 2nd 
command (ex: ls -a | grep _  <- takes ls -a and searches for files w/ _) 

> = Write data to a file (command > file) 
< = reading data from a file (I think?) 

Pressing tab can show options and autocomplete.

[directory name] . = opens everything in that project directory [ex code .]

cat [file name] = shows contents of file
