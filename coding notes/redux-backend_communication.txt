Getting initial state from backend:


Assuming an axios service file with a getAll method:

//other imports
import noteService from './services/notes'
import noteReducer, { setNotes } from './reducers/noteReducer'
//^assume setNotes is defined in the slice as setting state to payload

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    notes: noteReducer,
    otherReducer: otherReducer,
  }
})

noteService.getAll().then(notes =>
  store.dispatch(setNotes(notes)
  })
)

^note that the code isnt inside a function, thus
cant use async/await

Can also set initial state in App component with useEffect hook.

------------------------------------------------------------

Thunk:

$npm install redux-thunk

library that allows action creators that return a
function instead of an object. This allows for 
async action creators.

Async action creators can wait for some async operation to complete
and then dispatch an action.

^ex would be initializing state from a db:

^export const initializeNotes = () => {
  return async dispatch => {
    const notes = await noteService.getAll()
    dispatch(setNotes(notes))
  }
 }

^note that the dispatch being returned here is not useDispatch()
and does not require it imported/defined in the reducer file.
^also note that the async action creators are defined outside of
the createSlice method and exported seperately.
