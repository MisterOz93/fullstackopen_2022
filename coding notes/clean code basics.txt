		Javascript Clean Code

-Be consistent with indentation, whatever you choose to dp

- add semicolons even if they are mostly optional

-lines shouldn't be longer than 80 characters, indent if you're continuing
	a line and try to break *after* an operator or comma

-Always name things in camelCase, name things clearly. 

-Varibles should begin with a noun, functions begin with verb

-Don't use comments as notes to self, use them to explain what things do
or (when working in team) what changes were made. Don't overuse comments!

- Avoid making one big function, break it into smaller functions.
