Problem solving: 

Step 1: Understand the problem, express it in plain English. 

Step 2: Plan: consider the UI, the inputs (user? external?), the outputs you 
want, given the inputs, how do I get the desired output?

Pseudo code:

Write the code in English instead of syntax. 

Embrace pseudo code and practice it 

Step 3: Divide and Conquer. It's normal to not know every single step,
but figure out what steps you know and start with the simplest one. 

Do not try to solve it all at once! The key is **break down problems into
smaller and easier subproblems**. 

Decomposition is key to problem solving.
