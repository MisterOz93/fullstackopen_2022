css selectors: 
#for id selector, 
.for Class selector.
a:hover for pseudoclass (ex: hovering over anchor)
img[src] for attribute selector (ex: selects <img src=""> but not <img>)
many more selectors. those are just the basics. 


CSS is all about boxes, each box has (starting from inside to outside) 
padding, border, and margin. 


----------- Web forms------------------

Web forms allow users to enter data that is then sent to server to be
stored/processed. Or used client side to update the interface immediately.


A web form's HTML is made up of form controls (aka widgets) plus some 
other elements to help structure the form.

all forms start with a <form> element that closes. Standard practice is
to include the action and method attributes of the form.
^ex: <form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post"> </form>
^action attribute defines URL where data should be sent 
^method is which HTTP method to send data with (usually get or post).

all form controls should have a name attribute, 
the form data is sent to the server as name/value pairs.
