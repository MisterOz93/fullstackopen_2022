In case you end up in a situation where your application breaks because of 
library compatibility problems, downgrade to the older React by changing 
the file package.json as follows:

{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2", <----
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2", <---
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
After the change is made, reinstall dependencies by running

$npm install

Note that also the file index.js needs to be changed a bit. 

For React 17 it looks like

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
---------------------------------------------------------
but for React 18 the correct form is

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

import App from './App'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)
